# Compose

`docker-compose` deployment of microservices based document management service.
The services built built with `Golang` by using `Rabbitmq` and `Protobuf`.

## Services

There are two main services in the system, `Gateway` and `Storage`. Gateway service 
act as microservices api-gateway. Storage service do actual document management 
functions(ex: create documents in database). Client submit JSON documents to gateway 
service via REST api. Gateway service create `Protobuf` message based on the JSON 
data and pass it to storage service via `Rabbitmq`. Then storage service do what 
ever the operation(ex: create documents on a database) and sends the status back 
to gateway service as Protobuf message. Finally gateway service convert Protobuf 
message which receives from storage service into JSON object and send it back to 
client. Gateway service listen to Rabbitmq `gateway` queue and Storage service 
listen to `storage` queue.

## Compile protobuf

```
# install protoc
brew install protobuf

# install go protobuf
go get github.com/golang/protobuf
go get github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go

# complie protobuf
protoc spec/*.proto --go_out=:$GOPATH/src
```

## Deploy services

Change `host.docker.local` field in `.env` file to local machines ip or add
a host entry to `/etc/hosts` file by overriding `host.docker.local` with local
machines ip. In mac-os host.docker.local will route to localhost, so nothing to
change no mac-os.

```
docker-compose up -d rabbitmq
docker-compose up -d gateway
docker-compose up -d storage
```

## Test services

Gateway service expose document REST api on `/api/v1/documents:7654`. `JSON`
documents can be published to this api via `curl`.

```
// request
curl -v -XPOST "http://localhost:7654/api/v1/documents" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '
{
  "id": "1111",
  "name": "dot",
  "timestam": 89211232
}
'

// output
Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, POST is already inferred.
